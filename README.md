This report simply summaries the COVID-19 cases and death verse time, region, and transmission by some plots, and analyzes the relationship between the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and some variables such as some underlying disease that we are interested in. It also summarizes the results of statistical modeling and validated the model assumptions we made. We are trying to investigate the causal inference and association between the COVID-19 infection rate and other factors.
